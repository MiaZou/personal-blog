            Git is a brilliant guy who has created his first candy store named "master". Everybody has access to his online candy store as long as you have his github.com address. Today, he would like to share his candy store story with all of us.

            Where did he get his candy from? 
             - Git usually gets his candy from "local". Whenever his candy supply is running low at the online store or whenever his candy creating team invented another type of candy, he would load more candy to his online "master" store.

            git status: Tells the "local" situation, for example, how many small changes designers made in "local" that is different from the current "master" store. 

            git add --all: Loading bags of new version of candy to the truck.

            git commit -m "message": Candies are now loaded to the truck and ready to be shipped to the "master" store. Attached with a "message" from the local store manager briefly explaining what was new. The truck driver took the message and headed to the road.

            git push origin master: Truck arrived at the "master" store. Candies are loaded to the "master" store and available for everyone to look around!

            git checkout -b XXX: "master" store is making lots of profit! Due to the holiday season, Git wants to decorate the "master" store to match the Halloween theme. Git has hired a design company. Git did not want the design company to make decoration without his approval. So he has created a branch called XXX with the exact layout as the "master" store. Git is letting the design company decorate the XXX branch. 

            git branch: This is a map tells you how many branch Git has created offline. 

            git checkout xxx: This is a taxi that can transport Git from branches to branches. 

            git merge XXX: Once Git approved the design, git merge (which is a decorating company) would copy the XXX's branch to "master" store and make the Halloween decoration alive online!

            Happy Halloween!
